						<h4>API-First Philosophy</h4>
						<p>Being API-First means building out a high-quality API before writing application code. Our Fundamentals presentation includes more in-depth information about API-First development and the API lifecycle <a href="https://postman-solutions-eng.github.io/enterprise_enablement_content_101/#/apiFirst">here. </a>With the help of Postman, your workflow can look something like this:</p>
						<!-- graphic to model sections after -->
						<img src="images/api-first-development-hero.svg" style="width: 95%; height: 95%">
					</section>
					<section id="apiBuilder">
						<h4>How do collections relate to the API Builder?</h4>
						<p style = "font-size: large;"> Workflows can be organized around collections which stand in as a proxy for the API, but the API is the <strong>organizing principle</strong> for the requests, test suites, mocks, examples, monitors, and collections that relate to it. In other words, Postman collections are executable API descriptions.</p>
						<p style = "font-size: large;">For the aforementioned reasons, it would be reasonable to start with the API Builder in your producer workflow.</p>
						<img src="images/apiBuilder.gif" style="width: 95%; height: 95%">
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Let's break that down. Within the API Builder, you can define, document, test, deploy, and monitor an API. You can also generate your collection directly from the API Builder.</p>
						<img src="images/apiBuilderTab.png" style="width: 25%; height: 25%">
						<img src="images/apiBuilderNav.png" style="width: 95%; height: 95%">
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>It's also possible to develop an API specification modeled after a collection. In other words, it's possible to work in reverse to generate an API within Postman.</p>
						<p>Note that this isn't a formal process or feature in Postman yet, but <a href="https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-public-workspace/documentation/5922408-f21e770c-7d3b-4092-bdd6-288bb1d8d825" target="_blank">this collection</a>, shared by Matt Ball, can help you walk through this reversed scenario. This process originated from Kevin Swiber's tool, which you can use in your browser <a href="https://kevinswiber.github.io/postman2openapi/" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
					</section>
					<section id="specPhase">
						<h4>Specification Phase</h4>
						<p>If you'd like to see the API Builder in action, spend about 15 minutes with Arlemi in <a href="https://youtu.be/BUZiRtGRHj0" target="_blank">The Exploratory</a>.</p>
						<p>In this video, Arlemi explains how to create a new API and write/import a new specification.</p>
						<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BUZiRtGRHj0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Specification Phase Cont'd - Generating Server Code</h4>
						<p style = "font-size: large;">You can download a running server based on your API specification and use it as a starting point for development of your business logic.</p>
						<p style = "font-size: large;">In her <a href="https://blog.postman.com/use-your-work-in-postman-to-generate-code-for-your-apps/" target="_blank">blog post</a>,  Joyce shares that "Organizations like BigCommerce and Intuit use Postman code generation for developer onboarding. This allows external developers as well as new team members to get up to speed more quickly."</p>
						<img src="images/api-codegen.jpeg" style="width: 90%; height: 90%">
					</section>
					<section id="developPhase">
						<h4>Develop Phase - Mock Servers</h4>
						<p style = "font-size: large;">By adding a mock server to your collection and adding examples to your requests, you can simulate the behavior of a real API.</p>
						<p style = "font-size: large;">Using a mock server is also a best practice for testing APIs in a faster, more efficient way, which we will dive into more deeply in the next <a href="#fasterTestingSlides" target="_blank">learning path.</a></p>
						<img src="images/mocks-v8.jpeg" style="width: 95%; height: 95%">
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Develop Phase - Documentation</h4>
						<p style = "font-size: large;">Postman automatically generates basic, private documentation for any collection you create. It includes details for each request in the collection, along with sample code in various client languages. Request details include the <strong>method, authorization type, URL, headers, request and response structures, and examples</strong>. The documentation also displays <strong>all key-value pairs</strong> for request parameters, headers, and bodies.</p>
						<p style = "font-size: large;">Got 5 minutes? Watch Joyce walk through Postman's API documenation in this <a href="https://youtu.be/Ayo_KdLLcTA" target="_blank">video.</a></p>

						<p style = "font-size: large;">To learn more about documenting your API, check out our learning page <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/publishing-your-api/documenting-your-api/" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Develop Phase Cont'd - Documentation (Publishing)</h4>
						<p style = "font-size: large;">To publish documentation, it must be part of a collection. You can publish documentation for any collections that you created or have permission to edit.</p>
						<p style = "font-size: large;">Find more information about publishing documentation <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/publishing-your-api/publishing-your-docs/#making-your-documentation-public" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
						<p style="font-size: medium;">Note that publishing documentation for an API is one of many ways to <strong>increase adoption of that API </strong>, which we cover in a separate learning path within this presentation.</p>
						<img src="images/publishingDocumentation.jpeg">
					</section>
					<section id="testPhase">
						<h4>Test Phase - Writing and verifying tests</h4>
						<p style = "font-size: large;">You can create collections to use as test suites, integration tests, or contract tests for your API. These collections can be linked to a specific version of your API. To find more information about testing an API, please read our <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/testing-an-api/" target="_blank"> documention</a> or jog your memory about Postman tests, in general, by reviewing this <a href="https://postman-solutions-eng.github.io/enterprise_enablement_content_101/#/learningPath2" target="_blank"> learning path</a> from our Fundamentals presentation.</p>
						<p style = "font-size: large;">We'll cover how to test APIs faster and more efficiently in <a href="#fasterTestingSlides" target="_blank">this upcoming learning path.</a></p>
						<img src="images/addingTestToBuilder.gif" style="width: 95%; height: 95%">
					</section>
					<section id="deployPhase">
						<h4>Deployment Phase - CI/CD Pipeline</h4>
						<p style = "font-size: large;">In the API Builder, under the Test tab of any API version, you'll find an option to integrate with an existing CI/CD Pipeline, as documented <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/integrations/available-integrations/ci-integrations/circleci/" target="_blank">here</a>. After you set up the integration, you can view the status of builds or kick off a new build, all from within Postman. With the help of Newman and the Postman API, you also have the option to run API tests created in Postman as part of your CI pipeline.</p>
						<p style = "font-size: large;">In the API Builder, under the Test tab of any API version, you'll find an option to deploy to an existing API Gateway in AWS, as documented <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/integrations/available-integrations/aws-api-gateway/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
						<img src="images/apiBuilderNavTestAndDeploy.png" style="width: 100%; height: 100%">

					<section>
						<h4>Deployment Phase Cont'd - Monitors</h4>
						<p style = "font-size: large;">With Postman, you can monitor an API in several ways. Below, you'll see what a Monitor looks like in the Montiors tab found on the far left of the Postman app.</p>
						<p style = "font-size: large;">We'll cover how to use Monitors for faster testing in <a href="#fasterTestingSlides" target="_blank">this upcoming learning path.</a></p>
						<img src="images/Monitor.gif" style="width: 60%; height: 60%">
					</section>

						<h4>Postman's API testing Capabilities</h4>
						<p style="font-size: large;">As you might have guessed from exploring the other learning paths in this presentation, Postman supports the development of APIs through their entire lifecycle journies. There's no doubting, however, that many new Postman users arrive at the platform wanting to test APIs. Our previous <a href="https://postman-solutions-eng.github.io/enterprise_enablement_content_101/#/learningPath2" target="_blank"> Fundamentals course</a> goes over the very basics of API testing in Postman. To build on those basics, check out how Valentin Despa uses GitHub's API to create repositories and issues through Postman in this <a href="https://youtu.be/dDlsQrZmEmo" target="_blank">12-minute video</a>. As Valentin does this, he shows off advanced testing skills like, using dynamic variables, inspecting error messages, and leveraging test scripts.</p>

					</section>
					<section id="collectionRunner">
						<h4>Using the Collection Runner for Testing</h4>
						<p style="font-size: large;">If you're familiar with <a href="https://blog.postman.com/how-to-make-money-using-postman-chaining-requests/" target="_blank">chaining requests</a> in Postman, then you know you can leverage the "order of operations" we talk about in our <a href="https://postman-solutions-eng.github.io/enterprise_enablement_content_101/#/5/6" target="_blank"> Fundamentals </a> Debugging and Testing learning path to write pre-request and test scripts that run before and after an HTTP request (respectively). What if we told you that each request in this chain of requests within a collection could be set off, or run, with just one click? Well, this is exactly what we're talking about when we refer to the <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/test-scripts/#testing-collections-and-folders" target="_blank">Collection Runner</a>!</p>

						<h4>Monitors for Testing</h4>
						<p style="font-size: large;">Postman Monitors can be <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/monitoring-your-api/intro-monitors/#collection-based-monitors" target="_blank">collection-based</a>. They can also be set up to monitor <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/monitoring-your-api/monitoring-apis-websites/" target="_blank">entire APIs (multiple collections)</a>. Monitors give you continuous visibility into the health and performance of your APIs. Once the monitor is running you’ll get alerted to any failures, so you can quickly identify and address issues before your API’s consumers are affected. Spend 5 minutes with Joyce to see how she sets up a monitor in the Postman cloud <a href="https://youtu.be/tDQzY1Hn2LY?t=39" target="_blank">here.</a> In her video, Joyce also shares the benefits of having an automated monitor set up with notifications.</p>
